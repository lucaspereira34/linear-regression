# Linear Regression

**Linear Regression** is a **supervised learning** technique that uses labeled data to learn the relationship between input explanatory variables, which are assumed to be linearly related, and a quantitative dependent variable. As a **supervised learning** method, it can be used for predictive purposes.

## Simple Linear Regression

Models the relationship between a single **explanatory variable** (X) and a **dependent variable** (Y).

$$
Y = \alpha + \beta.X + \mu
$$

- $\alpha$ is the **intercept**, the starting point of the regression line on the Y-axis when X is zero.
- $\beta$ is the **slope** coefficient, which represents the steepness and direction of the line.
- $\mu$ is the **error** term.
