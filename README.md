# Linear Regression

**Linear Regression** is a **supervised learning** technique that uses labeled data to learn the relationship between input explanatory variables, which are assumed to be linearly related, and a quantitative dependent variable. As a **supervised learning** method, it can be used for predictive purposes.

## Simple Linear Regression

Models the relationship between a single explanatory variable (X) and a dependent variable (Y).

$$
Y = \alpha + \beta.X + \epsilon
